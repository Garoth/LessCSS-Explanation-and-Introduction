A presentation in impress.js that explains the shortcomings of CSS, and where
LessCSS steps in to fill the gaps.

Additionally, the presentation acts as a short introduction to Less' features,
and how they could be used idiomatically.

To view the presentation, check out the code and navigate your browser to the
local index.html file. Alternatively, you can see it live here:

It currently runs smoothest and with the fewest bugs using Safari on my test
system.

Thanks to:

Impress.js                For the presentation framework
google-code-prettify      For the code colorizer
Less                      For CSS compilation
Evernote                  For being ok with me making this during work hours

Also, if you're interested in Less, you may also like Sass. It has some
tradeoffs when compared to Less, but both are good projects -- with a great
deal of similarities.
